# cs24

CS24 was a class covering data structures.  


What I learned:
- basic data structures (nodes, single and double linked lists, binary search trees, creating custom data structures using structs)
- using const in function parameters
- abstraction 
- Complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- How to more efficiently troubleshoot programs

Please send me an email if you have any questions regarding these labs or projects. Thank you!
