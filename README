# cs24

CS24 was a class where I learned basic data structures in depth, such as linked lists, binary search trees, and custom data structures using the struct function in C++.  Additionally, I gained more experience programming in Visual Studio Code and VIM for C++ and compilation in OSX terminal.  Basic memory allocation (stack and heap) and Big O notation was also covered in some depth.
